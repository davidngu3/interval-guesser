# Interval Guesser
This is a small program I created while I was revising some music theory.  
The program prompts the user to answer with the correct number of semitones between two notes.  

## NOTE:  
It is expected that the semitones will be counted increasingly starting from the first note.

    Example 1: D to A  
    D -> D# (1 semitone) -> E (2 semitones) -> F (3 semitones) -> ... -> A (7 semitones)    
    
    Example 2: A to D  
    A -> A# (1 semitone) -> B (2 semitones) -> C (3 semitones) -> ... -> D (5 semitones)    

As a bonus, the program will also supply the user with the name of the interval.  
Good luck on your music theory adventures!
